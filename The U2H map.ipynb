    "# The U2H map \n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the application of the \"U2H map\" introduced in our paper (ArXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05652). Given a snapshot of current velocities and information on the incoming wave spectrum, the U2H map generates the current-induced changes in the significant wave height $h_s$ of deep-water surface gravity waves (SGWs), based on the assumptions listed in section 2 in our paper. \n",
