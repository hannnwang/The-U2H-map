# The-U2H-map
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of the "U2H map" introduced in our paper (ArXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05652). Given a snapshot of current velocities and information on the incoming wave spectrum, the U2H map generates the current-induced changes in the significant wave height hs of deep-water surface gravity waves.

The main code to run is "The U2H map.ipynb". The function and data files this code depends on are included in this repository.
